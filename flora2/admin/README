The release 0.99.4 (Kumquat) of Flora-2 fixes a number of bugs and adds new
features. This release includes a self-contained Windows installer and a
self-contained archive for installing Flora-2 under Linux, Mac, and other
Unixes. There is no need to install XSB separately -- everything is
included in the bundle.

The archive flora2bundle.tar.gz is for Linux/Mac/Cygwin users.
The installer flora2bundle.exe is for Windows users.
