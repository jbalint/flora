The release 0.99.3 (Aronia) of Flora-2 fixes a number of bugs and adds new
functionality, but its most significant feature is the new no-brainer
installation procedure, especially on Windows. It installs both Flora-2 and
XSB at once, so there is no need to download, configure, and install XSB
separately.

The archive flora2bundle.tar.gz is for Linux/Mac/Cygwin users.
The installer flora2bundle.exe is for Windows users.

and the installation instructions at
