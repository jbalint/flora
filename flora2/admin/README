The release 0.99.3 (Aronia) of Flora-2 fixes a number of bugs, but its most
significant innovation is the new no-brainer installation procedure,
especially on Windows. It installs both Flora-2 and XSB at once, so there
is no need to download, configure, and install XSB separately.

The archive flora2bundle.tar.gz is for Linux/Mac/Cygwin users.
The installer flora2bundle.exe is for Windows users.
