  Flora-2 relies on the XSB inference engine to run.
  One can install either the latest released version of Flora-2,
  Version 0.99.1 (Lotus) or the current development version from the
  SVN repository.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Note:</b> Use the SVN repository. The old CVS repository that was used by
   Flora-2 until now has been deprecated (but is still available).

   The Flora-2 Visualizer and Editor has its own <a href="visualizer.html">page

<h2 class="pane-head">Downloading the latest official release of Flora-2 (most users)</h2>
<p>
Please follow these steps:
<ul>
  <li>
  Download and install <a
  href="http://xsb.sourceforge.net/downloads/downloads.html"
  target="new_window">
  the latest release of XSB</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
  Download the <a
  href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/flora/files/Flora-2/"
  target="new_window">latest release</a> of Flora-2 into a separate directory
  and follow the <a href="installation.html" target="new_window">installation
  instructions</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
  Take a look at the <a href="release_notes.html#release"
  target="new_window">release notes</a> for the list of changes, bug fixes, and
  incompatibilities with previous versions.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="pane-head">Downloading the current development version from SVN (bleeding edge users)</h2>
<p>
  This version contains the latest features, but might not always be
  stable.  However,
  this allows you to track the development of Flora-2 and contribute!
  You can install the released version and
  the SVN version on the same system and switch between them at will
  (but not within the same session).
  The development version of Flora-2 often requires that you use the
  latest development version of XSB directly from the <a
  href="https://sourceforge.net/p/xsb/src/7781/tree/" target="new_window"> XSB's
  SVN
  repository</a>.  Under Windows, configuring the SVN version of XSB requires
  Microsoft's Visual Studio.
</p>
<p>
  Check out the latest version of Flora-2 from the
  <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/flora/src/HEAD/tree/" target="new_window">SVN repository</a>
  into a separate directory and follow the <a
  href="installation.html" target="new_window">installation instructions</a>.
  If you are not a developer, you can download a read-only copy by clicking on
  the RO button on that page and copying the appropriate SVN command that
  appears on the right. Please report to us any problems (and fixes!).
</p>
<p>
  <b>Note:</b> the development version downloaded from SVN is <em>not</em> 
  tested under Windows on a regular basis and has a higher probability of being
  unstable.
