  <h1>Installing FLORA-2</h1>
  
  <P>
    First, you need to download and
    install XSB: either
    <a href="http://xsb.sourceforge.net/downloads/downloads.html"
    target="new_window2">the latest
    released version</a>
    or <a href="https://sourceforge.net/scm/?type=cvs&group_id=1176"
    target="new_window2">the
    development version from XSB's CVS repository</a>.
    Then download FLORA-2 and follow the instructions below.
  </P>
  <p>
    The best way to instal FLORA-2 is to use a directory
    outside of the XSB source tree (for instance, 
    <tt>~/FLORA</tt>).
    After unpacking (or checking out from SVN) the FLORA-2
    sources will be placed in the subdirectory called <tt>flora2</tt>.
    (Under Windows, you need WinZIP in order to unpack FLORA-2 and XSB.)
  </p>

<h3>Configuring FLORA-2 under UNIX</h3>
<p>
  Execute the following commands
</p>

<pre>
 cd ~/FLORA/flora2
 make clean
 ./makeflora
</pre>

<p>
The last command will work only if an XSB executable is on the system search
path specified by the environment variable <tt>PATH</tt>. If it is not, then
additional parameters need to be supplied (here we assume that XSB is installed
in the directory <tt>~/XSB</tt>):
</p>
<pre>
 ./makeflora all ~/XSB/bin/xsb
</pre>
<p>
  If everything went well, you will be able to run FLORA-2 by typing
  ~/FLORA/flora2/runflora
</p>

<h3>Configuring FLORA-2 under Windows</h3>
<p>
You need Microsoft's <tt>nmake</tt>, which can be downloaded as part of Visual
C++ Express from 
<a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/products/visual-studio-express-products#2010-Visual-CPP"
    target="new_window2">http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/products/visual-studio-express-products#2010-Visual-CPP</a>.
Install Visual C++.
</p>
<p>
  Use the following commands
to configure FLORA-2 (assuming that XSB is installed and configured, its
executable is in <tt>D:\XSB\bin\xsb.bat</tt>,  and FLORA is installed in
<tt>D:\FLORA\flora2</tt>): 
</p>

<pre>
   PATH=C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\BIN;%PATH%
   cd D:\FLORA\flora2
   makeflora  clean
   makeflora D:\XSB\bin\xsb.bat
</pre>
<p>
   This assumes that Visual Studio was installed in the folder named
   <tt>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0</tt>. If it is installed
   elsewhere, make the appropriate adjustments.
</p>
<p>
   If you configured a 64-bit version of XSB, then configure FLORA-2 using
</p>
<pre>
  makeflora D:\XSB\bin\xsb64.bat
</pre>
<p>
Note: the Windows version of <tt>makeflora</tt> takes only one parameter,
while its Unix counterpart takes two.
</p>
<p>
   It is also recommended that you set the environment
   variable <code>HOME</code> on your Windows system, if it is not already
   defined. Environment variables are usually set by opening
   the <code>System</code> folder, which is located inside
   the <code>Settings</code> folder. Typically, the <code>HOME</code> variable
   is set to the directory
</p>
 <pre>
   "C:\Documents and Settings\<em>your-user-name</em>"
 </pre>

<p>
  Once FLORA-2 is installed, you can run it using the command
  D:\FLORA\flora2\runflora
</p>

<h3>Configuring FLORA-2 under Cygwin</h3>
<p>
  <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/"
    target="new_window2">Cygwin</a> is a free Unix emulator for
  Windows. The advantage of using XSB and FLORA-2 under Cygwin is that the
  system will run faster than under native Windows due to special optimizations
  that XSB has for the GCC compiler.
  The main disadvantage of Cygwin is that it is a fundamentally 32 bit system,
  which can use only up to 3GB of main memory. If your uses of FLORA-2 require
  more, you should bypass this option in favor of a native 64-bit builds of XSB
  and FLORA-2.
  </p>
  <p>
    You need a reasonably full installation
  of Cygwin. In particular, GCC and the related development tools (such
  as <tt>autoconf</tt>, <tt>make</tt>, etc.) must be installed.
  It is also desirable to have <tt>makedepend</tt>, which usually comes with
  the X11 package of Cygwin. 
  If you are
  planning to access a database, the ODBC DLL must also be installed.  XSB must
  be configured for Cygwin as well.
</p>
<p>
  Other than that, the installation steps for Cygwin are the same as under
  Unix.
