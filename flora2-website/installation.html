  <h1>Installing FLORA-2</h1>
  
  <P>
    First, you need to download and
    install <a
    href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1176">XSB</a>.
    Then download FLORA-2 and follow the instructions below.
  </P>
  <p>
    The most flexible way to instal FLORA-2 is to use a directory
    outside of the XSB directory tree (for instance, 
    <tt>~/FLORA</tt>).
    After unpacking (or checking out from CVS) the FLORA-2
    sources will be placed in the subdirectory called <tt>flora2</tt>.
    (Under Windows, you need WinZIP in order to unpack FLORA-2 and XSB.)
  </p>

<h3>Configuring FLORA-2 under UNIX</h3>
<p>
  Execute the following commands
</p>

<pre>
 cd ~/FLORA/flora2
 make clean
 ./makeflora
</pre>

<p>
The last command will work only if an XSB executable is on the system search
path specified by the environment variable <tt>PATH</tt>. If it is not, then
additional parameters need to be supplied (here we assume that XSB is installed
in the directory <tt>~/XSB</tt>):
</p>
<pre>
 ./makeflora all ~/XSB/bin/xsb
</pre>
<p>
  If everything went well, you can run FLORA-2 by typing
  ~/FLORA/flora2/runflora
</p>

<h3>Configuring FLORA-2 under Windows</h3>
<p>
You need Microsoft's <tt>nmake</tt>, which can be downloaded from 
<a
href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/vc15/Patch/1.52/W95/EN-US/Nmake15.exe">http://download.microsoft.com/download/vc15/Patch/1.52/W95/EN-US/Nmake15.exe</a>.
The file <tt>Nmake15.exe</tt> is a self-extracting archive; when it is run, it
extracts the program files for <tt>nmake.exe</tt>  into the same directory where
you downloaded <tt>Nmake15.exe</tt>.  Let's say this directory is
<tt>C:\Nmake</tt>.
</p>
<p>
  Use the following commands
to configure FLORA-2 (assuming that XSB is installed and configured, its
executable is in <tt>D:\XSB\bin\xsb.bat</tt>,  and FLORA is installed in
<tt>D:\FLORA\flora2</tt>): 
</p>

<pre>
   PATH=C:\Nmake;%PATH%
   cd D:\FLORA\flora2
   makeflora  clean
   makeflora D:\XSB\bin\xsb.bat
</pre>
<p>
Note: the Windows version of <tt>makeflora</tt> takes only one parameter,
while its Unix counterpart takes two.
</p>
<p>
   It is also recommended that you set the environment
   variable <code>HOME</code> on your Windows system, if it is not already
   defined. Environment variables are usually set by opening
   the <code>System</code> folder, which is located inside
   the <code>Settings</code> folder. Typically, the <code>HOME</code> variable
   is set to the directory
</p>
 <pre>
   "C:\Documents and Settings\<em>your-user-name</em>"
 </pre>
 <p>
    Such a setting will prevent certain problems with upgrading FLORA-2 from
    earlier versions.
 </p>

<p>
  You can then run FLORA-2 using the command
  D:\FLORA\flora2\runflora
</p>

<h3>Configuring FLORA-2 under Cygwin</h3>
<p>
  <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> is a free Unix emulator for
  Windows. The advantage of using XSB and FLORA-2 under Cygwin is that the
  system will run faster than under native Windows due to special optimizations
  that XSB has for the GCC compiler.  You need a reasonably full installation
  of Cygwin. In particular, GCC and the related development tools (such
  as <tt>autoconf</tt>, <tt>make</tt>, etc.) must be installed.
  It is also desirable to have <tt>makedepend</tt>, which usually comes with
  the X11 package of Cygwin. 
  If you are
  planning to access a database, the ODBC DLL must also be installed.  XSB must
  be configured for Cygwin as well.
</p>
<p>
  Other than that, the installation steps for Cygwin are the same as under
  Unix.
