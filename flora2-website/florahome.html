<p>
FLORA-2 is an advanced object-oriented knowledge base management system
and application
development environment.  It is a dialect of F-logic with
numerous extensions, including meta-programming in the style of HiLog,
logical updates in the style of Transaction Logic, and defeasible reasoning.
FLORA-2 was designed with
extensibility and flexibility in mind, and it provides strong support for
modular software design through its unique feature of dynamic modules.
</p>
<p>
Applications of FLORA-2 include intelligent agents, Semantic Web,
knowledge-bases networking, ontology management, integration of information,
and more.
</p>
<p>
  FLORA-2 relies on the <a href="http://xsb.sourceforge.net" target="new_window">XSB inference
  engine</a>, which must be installed in order to
  use FLORA-2. This release of FLORA-2 requires the latest released version
  of XSB.

May 13, 2013: After more than 5 years of development under the sponsorship
of <a href="http://www.vulcan.com">Vulcan Inc.</a>, FLORA-2 <a href="download.html">version
0.99 (Water Lily)</a> has been released!
This release includes many enhancements and extensions, including defeasible
rules, user-defined functions, delay quantifiers, rule Ids, and more.
Details can be found in the <a href="release_notes.html">release notes</a>.
The license has also changed from LGPL 2.0 to Apache 2.0.
</p>
<p>
   Please note that the CVS repository is now obsolete and is no longer
   maintained. The current source code and all future development will be using
   the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/flora/src/HEAD/tree/">SVN repository
   at Sourceforge</a>.
</p>
   
<p>
FLORA-2 comes with comprehensive <a
href="documentation.html">manuals</a> and a
<a href="tutorial.html">tutorial</a>, which provide an overview of
theoretical foundations as well as of
the FLORA-2 language and system. The tutorial is
accompanied by programming examples and exercises.
