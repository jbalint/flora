<p>
FLORA-2 is an advanced object-oriented knowledge base management system
and application
development environment.  It is a dialect of F-logic with
numerous extensions, including meta-programming in the style of HiLog,
logical updates in the style of Transaction Logic, and defeasible reasoning.
FLORA-2 was designed with
extensibility and flexibility in mind, and it provides strong support for
modular software design through its unique feature of dynamic modules.
</p>
<p>
Applications of FLORA-2 include intelligent agents, Semantic Web,
knowledge-bases networking, ontology management, integration of information,
and more.
</p>
<p>
FLORA-2 comes with comprehensive <a
href="documentation.html">manuals</a> and a
<a href="tutorial.html">tutorial</a>, which provide an overview of
theoretical foundations as well as of
the FLORA-2 language and system. The tutorial is
accompanied by programming examples and exercises.
</p>

<p>
  FLORA-2 relies on the <a href="http://xsb.sourceforge.net"
  target="new_window">XSB inference engine</a>, which must be installed in
  order to run FLORA-2.
