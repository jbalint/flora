<h2 class="pane-head">About</h2>
<p>
<span class="emph-text">Flora-2</span>&nbsp; is an advanced object-oriented
knowledge representation and reasoning
system. It is a dialect of F-logic with
numerous extensions, including meta-programming in the style of HiLog,
logical updates in the style of Transaction Logic, and defeasible reasoning.
<!--
Flora-2 was designed with
extensibility and flexibility in mind, and it provides strong support for
modular software design through its unique feature of dynamic modules.
-->
Applications include intelligent agents, Semantic Web,
knowledge-bases networking, ontology management, integration of information,
security policy analysis, and more.
</p>
<p>
Flora-2 comes with comprehensive <a
href="documentation.html">manuals</a> and a
<a href="tutorial.html">tutorial</a>, which provide an overview of
the theoretical foundations as well as 
the system. The tutorial includes
many examples and exercises.
</p>

<!--
<p>
  Flora-2 relies on the <a href="http://xsb.sourceforge.net"
  target="new_window2">XSB inference engine</a>, which must be installed in
  order to run Flora-2.
</p>
