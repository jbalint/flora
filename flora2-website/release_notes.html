      <h1 class="emph-text"> Release Notes for Version 0.99.5 (Olive)</h1>
    </center>
    <h2 class="pane-head">General</h2>
    <p>
       Several new features, including two major extensions: <em>set
       notation</em> and <em>first-order formulas in rule bodies</em>.
    </p>
    <h2 class="pane-head">News</h2>
    <ul>    
      <li>
	 Set notation: it is now possible to use set notation virtually
	 everywhere. Previously this was allowed only as the value part of
	 methods, e.g., <tt>a[b->{c,d}]</tt>. Now it is possible to write
	 things like <tt>p({1,2,3})</tt> as a shorthand for <tt>p(1)</tt>,
	 <tt>p(2)</tt>, <tt>p(3)</tt>. Or <tt>?X={?Y,?Z,abc}</tt> instead of
	 <tt>?X=?Y</tt>, <tt>?Y=?Z</tt>, <tt>?Y=abc</tt>. Or <tt>{a,b,c}:d</tt>. Even
	 <tt>{p,q}({1,2})</tt>.     
      </li>
      <li>      
	 Arbitrary first-order formulas are now possible in rule bodies,
	 including universal quantifiers. This is done through the well-known
	 Lloyd-Topor transformation to normal rules. The transform works with
	 the quantifiers <tt>forall</tt>, <tt>exists</tt>, and the
	 connectives <tt>naf</tt>, <tt>~~></tt>, 
	 <tt>if-then-else</tt>,  and the like.
	 This makes some complex rule much easier to write and makes this
	 process less error-prone.
      </li>
      <li>      
	 Loading commands are now aware of the <tt>#include</tt> statements and
	 recompile loaded files if any of the included files change.
      </li>
      <li> 
	If the environment variable <tt>FLORA_RC_FILE</tt> is set and points
	to a readable initialization file, Flora-2 will read startup commands
	(any set of Flora-2 queries) from it.
      </li>
      <li> The previously existing
	 primitives <tt>_isinteger/1</tt>, <tt>_isvar/1</tt>,
	<tt>_isground/1</tt>,
	 etc., have now been documented. Also added their <em>delayable</em>
	 2-argument counterparts.
      </li>
    </ul>

    </center>
    <h2 class="pane-head">General</h2>
    <p>
       This version contains many bug fixes, some infrastructure improvements,
       and a small number of new features.
    </p>
    <h2 class="pane-head">News</h2>
    <ul>    
      <li>
	 The rule id is now a triple: (local-id, filename, module).
	 The corresponding operations such as enable{...} and disable{...}
	 have been updated.
      </li>
      <li>      
	 The new transactional enable/disable primitives: tenable{...} and
	 tdisable{...}.
      </li>
      <li>      
	 A new feature: latent queries. This kind of queries can be seen as a
	 cross between normal queries and rules.
      </li>
      <li>      
	 New quasi-constants: <tt>_@F</tt>: the file name where this
	 constant occurs; <tt>_@L</tt>: the line number where this constant
	 occurs; <tt>_@C</tt>: a substitute for caller{...} (the caller
	 primitive hasn't been deprecated).   
	 These and other quasi-constants and quasi-variables are now summarized
	 in a separate section in the manual.
      </li>
      <li>      
	 New builtin descriptor properties: <tt>file</tt> and <tt>module</tt>.
	 Can be used to query the file and module components of rule Ids.
      </li>
      <li>      
	 Builtins operations on XML data types and others are much more
	 memory-efficient now.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="pane-head">Backward Incompatibility</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
	The methods defined in the standard modules like <tt>_system</tt>,
	<tt>_io</tt>, <tt>_typecheck</tt>, and others no longer have
	the <tt>%</tt> in front of the methods. For example,
	<tt>Method[mustDefine(on)]@_sys</tt> instead
	of <tt>Method[%mustDefine(on)]@_sys</tt>.  
      </li>
      <li>      
	 The methods defined in the module <tt>_basetype</tt> used to be
	 prefixed with an underscore <tt>_</tt>. No longer. For instance,
	 <tt>123[toSymbol->?R]@_basetype</tt>   rather than
	 <tt>123[_toSymbol->?R]@_basetype</tt>.
      </li>
      <li>      
	 <u>In the future</u>,
	 we are planning to change the convention and replace
	 the underscore <tt>_</tt> in front of the
	 various builtin constructs with the backslash <tt>\</tt>. For instance,
	 <tt>\#</tt> instead of <tt>_#</tt>, <tt>\io</tt> instead
	 of <tt>_io</tt>.   
      </li>
      <li>      
	 Likewise <tt>in the future</tt>,   we will eliminate the arrows <tt>*-></tt> and
	 <tt>*=></tt>, as they cause much confusion. Instead, the class
	 properties will be written using the <tt>[|...|]</tt> syntax while
	 object properties will use the old <tt>[...]</tt> syntax.
	 For instance, instead of <tt>abc[foo*->1,bar*=>_integer]</tt> we'll be using
	 <tt>abc[|foo->1,bar=>\integer|]</tt>. It will no longer be possible to
	 mix the class-level and object-level notation in the same F-molecule.
      </li>
    </ul>

    </center>
    <h2 class="pane-head">General</h2>
    <p>
       This version contains a number of bug fixes plus a new installation
       procedure.
    </p>
    <h2 class="pane-head">News</h2>
    <ul>    
      <li>
       We have switched to <em>bundled</em> releases where the downloads
       contain both a suitable version of XSB and the latest release of
       Flora-2. One simple script now installs both and there is no need to
       install XSB separately. On Windows, a simple installer guides the
       installation, as usual for Windows programs.
    <p>
       Users who download the latest versions of XSB and Flora-2 from their
       SVN repositories are unaffected by this new installation procedure.
    </p>
      </li>
    <li>
       XSB and Flora-2 can now be installed in directories that have spaces in
       them.
    </li>
    <li>
       Evaluation of negation (naf) is now delayed automatically,
       if the subgoal has unbound variables. The delay takes place as long as
       there is still a possibility that those variables can be bound.
       This makes for a more logical treatment of negation.
    </li>
    <li>
       Inheritance can now be blocked via explicit negative information
       (manual, Section 16.2).
    </li>
    </ul>

       and various extensions.
    </p>
    <h2 class="pane-head">News</h2>
    <p>
      This is a maintenance release that fixes several bugs and provides several
      minor enhancements.
    </p>
    <ul>    
      <li>
	The compiled and the auxiliary files produced by Flora-2 are now in the
	.flora_aux_files subdirectory of the .flr file being compiled.
      </li>
      <li>
	 <tt>=..</tt> now works with complex reified statements such as
	 if-then-else, update operators, negation, and others. 
      </li>
      <li>      
	UDFs can now be arbitrary HiLog terms, not necesarily of the form
	functor(args).
      </li>
      <li>      
	 Full support for rule descriptors, including the new syntax for
	 querying them.
      </li>
      <li>      
	 Skolem symbold are now allowed in the rule bodies also outside of
	 reifications and rule descriptors. An occurrence of a _# is
	 interpreted as a test that that particular argument is bound to a
	 skolem constant. An occurrence of a numbered Skolem, e.g. _#5,
	 is interpreted the same except that multiple occurrences of the same
	 numbered Skolem in the body of the same rule are interpreted as
	 occurrences of the same Skolem.
      </li>
      <li>      
	 The auxiliary files generated by the compiler are now neatly stowed
	 away in subdirectories called <tt>.flora_aux_files</tt>. 
      </li>
      <li>      
	 The rarely used and unnecessary "package" install mode
	 for Flora-2 has been eliminated.
      </li>
      <li>      
	 The restriction that Flora-2 cannot be installed in Windows folders
	 whose paths contain spaces is believed to be gone for good.
      </li>
      <li>      
	 Greatly simplified installation for official releases.
	 (Installation for SVN downloads and developers is unchanged.)
      </li>
      <li>      
	 Incompatible change: the keyword used to define user-defined functions
	 has been changed from <tt>function</tt> to <tt>udf</tt>. Likewise, the
	 directive <tt>usefunction</tt> has been changed to <tt>useudf</tt>.

    </center>

    <h2 class="pane-head">General</h2>
    <p>
      Flora-2 has undergone significant changes to make it more of a Web
      language.  The system has also become more robust and many interfaces and
      enhancements were added.  The syntax has been changed somewhat to make
      Flora-2 better aligned with other Semantic Web languages and, especially,
      with other F-logic based languages.  This resulted in incompatible
      changes with respect to version 0.94 (see below; a special script is
      provided to simplify conversion of old programs to the new syntax).
    </p>

    <h2 class="pane-head">News</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
	A new Java API
      </li>
      <li>      
	 A new Eclipse-based editor/visualizer.
      </li>
      <li>
	It is now possible to save the current state of a module in a file.
      </li>
      <li>      
	 Directive for importing one module into another.
      </li>
      <li>
	The meta-decomposition operator <tt>=..</tt>  now works not only for
	Prolog terms but also for HiLog terms and for reified formulas.
      </li>
      <li>
	It is now possible to specify the type (signature) of a Boolean method.
      </li>
      <li>
	Cardinality constraints can now be specified in class signatures.
	There are now standard methods for checking type and cardinality
	constraints. They are defined for classes <tt>Type</tt>
	and <tt>Cardinality</tt>, respectively, in the system
	module <tt>_typecheck</tt>.
      </li>
      <!--
      <li>
	The user can now specify insert/delete hooks. These are
	methods/predicates that will be called on each insert/delete.
      </li>
      -->
      <li>      
	 Structured primitive types, such
	 as <tt>dateTime</tt>, <tt>time</tt>, <tt>IRI</tt>, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
	New syntax for compacr URIs to simplify specification of Web resources.
      </li>
      <li>      
	 New system library for reading and parsing terms from standard input,
	 strings, and files.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="pane-head">Backward Incompatibility</h2>
    <p>
      <i>Major incompatible changes of syntax</i>: Some aspects of the syntax
      has been aligned with other rule languages for the Web and with F-logic
      based systems. There is a Perl script, <tt>convert.pl</tt>, in
      the <tt>Misc</tt> subdirectory, which can greatly simplify conversion of
      the old Flora-2 programs.  The file Misc/README explains how to use this
      program.
      </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Variables now start with ? and uppercase alphanumeric atoms do not need
	to be quoted.
      </li>
      <li>
	Transactional methods are now designated with the prefix % instead of
	#.
      </li>
      <li>      
	 The <tt>equality(flogic)</tt> option in the <tt>setsemantics</tt>
	 directive has been deprecated.  
      </li>
      <li>      
	 The meaning of path expressions in the head of a rule has changed:
	 they no longer create a new skolem term if the path expression does
	 not have a value. Instead, the body of the rule is considered false in
	 such a case.
      </li>
      <li>      
	 The <tt>@prolog()</tt>  and <tt>@prolog(module)</tt> module
	 specifications   have been changed to <tt>@_prolog</tt> and
	 <tt>@_prolog(module)</tt>. To sweeten the pill, <tt>_plg</tt> instead
	 of <tt>_prolog</tt> is also allowed. Likewise, <tt>@prologall()</tt>
	 and <tt>@prologall(module)</tt> have become  <tt>@_prologall</tt>
	 and <tt>@_prologall(module)</tt>, respectively, and the abbreviation
	 <tt>_plgall</tt> is also accepted. 
      </li>
      <li>      
	 The system module syntax <tt>@flora(module)</tt> has been changed to
	 <tt>@_module</tt>. For instance, <tt>@flora(sys)</tt> is
	 now <tt>@_sys</tt>.   
      </li>
      <li>      
	 <tt>debug[%check_undefined(on)]@flora(sys)</tt> is now

	 <tt>flImport</tt> is now <tt>'_flimport'</tt>.  
      </li>
      <li>      
	 Pretty printing is now provided by a package rather than
	 a system module. Invocation now differs slightly.
      </li>
      <li>      
	 In-place module, which allows the user to type a program at command
	 line  is now <tt>.</tt> (period) instead of the keyword <tt>user</tt>

      The development of Flora-2 has continued unabated.  Apart from making the
      system more robust, we added a large number of enhancements.  The syntax
      has also been cleaned up, which resulted in incompatible changes with
      respect to version 0.92 (see below).
    </p>

    <h2 class="pane-head">News</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Modules can now be encapsulated. A module can export methods and
	predicates to all modules our to a particular list of predicates.
      </li>
      <li>
	One can now reify rules in addition to facts and other formulas.
      </li>
      <li>
	The new directives <tt>setsemantics{...}</tt>
	and <tt>semantics{...}</tt>  allow the programmer set and query the
	semantics of any module.
      </li>
      <li>
	It is now possible to use "and" and "or" instead of "," and ";" when
	the latter mean conjunction and disjunction, respectively.
      </li>
      <li>
	A new predicate, <tt>flora_query</tt>, can now be used to send
	arbitrary queries to Flora-2 from the Prolog side.  This means that one
	can use the XSB C or Java interfaces to send queries to Flora-2 through
	an intermediate Prolog module.
      </li>
      <li>
	The <tt>clause{...}</tt>  primitive lets one query the rule base.
      </li>
      <li>
	The commands <tt>flAdd file</tt> and <tt>[+file]</tt> can now add
	contents to modules instead of erasing it.  The
	command <tt>flCompileAdd</tt> is used to compile files for later
	loading into a module. It does not by itself load any files.
      </li>
      <li>
	Enhanced checking for undefined methods and predicates. The new
	directive
	<tt>#ignore_undefcheck</tt> allows to selectively relax checks for
	undefinedness in cases where such checks are undesirable.
      </li>
      <li>
	The following types are now predefined: integer, float, number, symbol,
	(a,b), (a;b), (a-b).
      </li>
      <li>
	There is now a rudimentary run-time optimizer, which the user can turn
	of and off dynamically. See <tt>flOptimize</tt>.

      <li>
	Inheritance-less <tt>inheritance(none)</tt> semantics is now supported
	in addition to the usual semantics where inheritance is the default.
      </li>
      <li>
	Experimental support for persistent Flora-2 modules, which are stored
	in a database through the ODBC interface.
      </li>
      <li>  
	Experimental support for XML/HTML/SGML parsing and XPath queries.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="pane-head">Backward Incompatibility</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
	<i>Major incompatible change of syntax</i>: HiLog predicates are now
	tabled by default. Non-tabled predicates must now be prefixed with a #,
	by analogy with non-tabled methods. The <tt>table</tt> directive has
	been deprecated.
      </li>
      <li>
	The symbol % is no longer starting a comment. Use /*...*/ and //
	instead.  The symbol % will be reused for other purposes.
      </li>
      <li>
	The "<tt>equality</tt>" directive has been deprecated. Use the new
	<tt>setsemantics</tt> directive.
      <li>
	Constructs like a[attr=&gt; {b,c}] and a[attr=&gt;&gt; {b,c}]
	are no longer legal (i.e., the curly braces in the context of

	instead.
      </li>
      <li> Prolog predicates <tt>call/1</tt> and <tt>findall/3</tt> are no

      Flora-2 has undergone many changes and a great number of features were
      added. Some changes make the syntax of the present version incompatible
      with earlier versions. However, these changes simplify the language and
      improve its usability.

      It is the first version that is reasonably feature-complete and thus
      can be called a "beta".
    </p>


    <h2 class="pane-head">News</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Major changes in the language: there are no firstorder predicates any
	more -- all are HiLog. See backward incompatibility.
      </li>
      <li>
	It is now possible to add new rules to the program at run time as well
	as create new program modules at run time. This is useful for agent
	programming. Typically one would use this feature by creating a new
	module and then adding rules to it at run time. Then calling the
	methods defined in that module.
      </li>
      <li>
	Inheritance is now implemented in accordance with the semantics defined

      </li>
      <li>It is now possible to call X@Module, where X and/or Module is a
	variable. This allows one to construct a term and then call it in a
	module or to query the modules in which a term is defined. For
	instance, the following will work: ..., p(X), X(a,Y), X@foo.
      </li>
      <li>
	Flora now honors XSB
	directives --nobanner, --noprompt, --quietload. This makes it easier to
	put graphical interfaces on top of Flora and simplifies interprogram
	communication.
      </li>
      <li>
	The update operators now also update the tabling information, which
	makes them much better behaved with queries.  The new operator
	refresh{...} provides finer-grained control over cached queries.
      </li>
      <li>
	It is now possible to table HiLog predicates, but expect more changes
	to this syntax in future versions.
      </li>
      <li>
	Flora-2 now works under Cygwin. People might prefer this to the native
	Windows port, because it runs significantly faster.

    <ul>
      <li>There was a subtle bug in the behavior of multiple inheritance. This
	has now been fixed. Inheritance (and especially multiple inheritance)
	has now a well-defined model theoretic semantics, as described in

      <h1 class="emph-text"> Release Notes for Version 0.88 (Phalaenopsis intermedia)</h1>
    </center>

    <h2 class="pane-head">General</h2>
    <p>
      This release introduces a number of new features, improves performance,
      and stability. The main highlights are the significantly faster
      compilation and improved support for reified statements. Some new
      features, such as the interface to CLPR constraint solving requires the
      latest version of XSB (from the CVS repository). It is also required, if
      you want to run Flora-2 under Windows.
    </p>


    <h2 class="pane-head">News</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Many bug fixed and many new features.
      </li>
      <li> Significantly reduced compilation time for some programs.
      </li>
      <li> The new token <tt>_@</tt>, which denotes the current Flora-2 module.
      </li>
      <li> The new <tt>@prologall()</tt> module specification, which
	automatically converts the arguments of Prolog calls between the Flora-2
	and Prolog representation as needed.
      </li>
      <li> The new reification operator ${...}. Say, x[m-&gt; ${a[b-&gt;c]}]
	will reify the formula a[b-&gt;c]. This is in addition to the
	previously available meta-argument specification (called "bform" before
	and now changed to "meta").
      </li>
      <li>
	New syntax: ..., {constraint},... which allows Flora programs to use
	the CLPR constraint solver of XSB.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="pane-head">Bugfixes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Works again under Windows.</li>
      <li> Numerous other small bugs.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="pane-head">Backward Incompatibility</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> The predicate <tt>flThisModule/1</tt> has been deprecated. Use the
	literal <tt>_@</tt> to refer to the current module. This is more
	convenient and faster.
      </li>
      <li> The <tt>bform</tt> argument specifier is now called <tt>meta</tt>.
      </li>
    </ul>

      <h1 class="emph-text"> Release Notes for Version 0.86</h1>
    </center>

    <h2 class="pane-head">General</h2>
    <p>
      This release fixes many bugs, eliminates some restrictions, and adds
      new features.
    </p>

    <h2 class="pane-head">News</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> The most important new feature is the ability to check for undefined
	predicates and methods in debug mode (see the manual regarding checking
	undefinedness checks). This feature simplifies debugging considerably.
      </li>
      <li> Flora compiler now checks if a tabled predicate depends on an update
	operation and issues appropriate warnings. Such dependency is
	considered to be a likely program bug.
      </li>
      <li> Numbered anonymous oids added (e.g., _#123). They behave like
	regular anonymous oids (_#) in the sense that they are substituted by a
	new oid.  However, numbered oids can be referenced within the same
	clause (e.g., _#12[self-&gt;_#12]).
      </li>
      <li> Optimized compilation of path expressions and nested terms.
      </li>
    </ul>
