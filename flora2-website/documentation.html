  <h1>FLORA-2 Documentation</h1>

<p>
  Currently
  there are two documents: the main FLORA-2 manual and a manual describing the
  packages that are not core part of the system, but are important additions
  and are distributed with the system.
  In addition, there is a tutorial that covers the main aspects of the theory
  behind FLORA-2 as well as introduces the key features of the
  system.
  <!--
  In addition, <a href="visualizer.html">FLORA-2 Visualizer and editor</a>
  has its own documentation, which is accessible
  <a href="visualizer.html">here</a>.
