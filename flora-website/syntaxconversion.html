<h1>Converting from Old to New F-logic Syntax: V. 0.94 to 0.95</h1>

<p>
  FLORA-2 users who have knowledge bases that use the old F-logic syntax should
   convert to the new syntax in order to use Release 0.95 and later.
   The <tt>Misc/</tt> subdirectory in the FLORA-2 distribution includes a Perl
   script, convert.pl, and a README file, which explains how to use the script
   to convert to the new syntax.
</p>
<p>
   The convert.pl script does not guarantee complete conversion, but it does
   95% of the job. It does not handle correctly the #define macros in that it
   adds ? to all of them. These should be undone manually. It also does not
   convert the code that appears inside comments or strings.
